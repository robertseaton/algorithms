Various algorithms in Haskell.

Currently implemented:
* Naive version of exponentiation.
* Divide and conquer, O(lg n) version of exponentiation. 
* Mergesort.
* Quicksort.
* Insertion sort.
* Naive, (phi^n) Fibonacci numbers.
* Bottom up, O(n) Fibonacci numbers.
* Closed-form solution to Fibonacci numbers, which relies on floating point and thus isn't terribly accurate.
* Matrix-based, O(lg n) Fibonacci numbers.
